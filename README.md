# ✅ `Prysmax PREMIUM & FUD`

- There is no need for me to describe it, but the major media have already analyzed it.

- [CyFirma](https://www.cyfirma.com/outofband/new-maas-prysmax-launches-fully-undetectable-infostealer/)
- [TheHackersNews](https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/new-hijackloader-modular-malware-loader.html)

Prysmax is an advanced data stealer, be it wallets, sessions of all kinds and full remote control of victims' computers. But what sets it apart from the rest is that Prysmax is totally undetectable to all anti virus scanners on the market, as well as to virtual signature scanners like VirusTotal. Basically it is elusive to all detection methods which is why it is so dangerous and powerful.
